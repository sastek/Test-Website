This is a test website for gulp, jekyll, sass and jade

This is based on Shaky Shane's repository at https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync
and on Travis Neilson's repository at https://github.com/travisneilson/Design-Code

A big shout out to both of them for getting me started.
